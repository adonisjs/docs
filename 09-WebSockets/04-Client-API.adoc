toc::[]

This guide covers the documentation around the JavaScript client used for connecting to the websocket server.

== Installation
You can install the package from npm and then bundle it using Webpack or rollup.

[source, bash]
----
npm i @adonisjs/websocket-client
----

and then import it as follows

[source, js]
----
import Ws from '@adonisjs/websocket-client'
const ws = Ws('ws://localhost:3333')
----

Also you can grab the UMD bundle from unpkg.
[source, html]
----
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@adonisjs/websocket-client"></script>
<script>
  const ws = adonis.Ws('ws://localhost:3333')
</script>
----

== Polyfill
The module build requires link:https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-regenerator[regenerator-runtime] polyfill, so make sure to add it via babel.

== Production builds
The development build contains a bunch of log statements, so it is recommended to use link:https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/[Webpack DefinePlugin] or link:https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-replace[rollup-plugin-replace] in order to define `NODE_ENV`.

== Getting started
Let's get started by connecting to the Websocket server and make some subscriptions.

NOTE: If `url` is not defined, it will fallback to the current hostname. Otherwise a complete URL with `ws` protocol is required.

[source, js]
----
const ws = Ws(url, options)

// connect to the server
ws.connect()
----

==== options

[role="resource-table", options="header", cols="30%, 10%, 60%"]
|===
| Key | Default Value | Description
| path | *adonis-ws* | The path to the used for making the connection. Only change, if you changed it on the server
| reconnection | *true* | Whether or not make reconnect automatically after disconnect
| reconnectionAttempts | *10* | Number to reconnection attempts to be made, before giving up
| reconnectionDelay | *1000* | How long to wait, before reconnecting. The value will be used as `n x delay`, where `n` is the current value of reconnection attempts.
| query | *null* | Query string to passed to the connection URL. You can pass an object
| encoder | *JsonEncoder* | The encoder to be used. The same encoder will be required on the server too.
|===

It is recommended to listen for `open` and `close` events, to manage your application state properly.

[source, js]
----
let isConnected = false

ws.on('open', () => {
  isConnected = true
})

ws.on('close', () => {
  isConnected = false
})
----

Once, connected you can subscribe to different/multiple topics.

[source, js]
----
const chat = ws.subscribe('chat')

chat.on('ready', () => {
  chat.emit('message', 'hello')
})

chat.on('error', (error) => {
  console.log(error)
})

chat.on('close', () => {
})
----

== Subscription API
Following is the list of methods to be used for sending/receiving messages.

==== emit(event, data)
Send event to the server

[source, js]
----
chat.emit('message', {
  body: 'hello',
  user: 'virk'
})
----

==== on(event, callback)
Bind event listener

[source, js]
----
chat.on('message', () => {})
chat.on('new:user', () => {})
----

==== off(event, callback)
Remove event listener

[source, js]
----
const messageHandler = function () {}

chat.on('message', messageHandler)
chat.off(messageHandler)
----

==== close()
Initiate request to close the subscription. You must wait for the `close` event, to mark the subscription as closed.

[source, js]
----
chat.on('close', () => {
  // server acknowledged close
})

chat.close()
----

==== leaveError
The `leaveError` event is emitted, when server refuses to close the subscription. This ideally will never occur.

[source, js]
----
chat.on('leaveError', (response) => {
  console.log(response)
})
----

==== error
Emitted when error occurs on the TCP connection. Ideally you must be listening to `ws.on('error')` event.

[source, js]
----
chat.on('error', (event) => {
})
----

==== close
Emitted when subscription is closed.

[source, js]
----
chat.on('close', () => {
})
----

== Ws API
Below is the list of methods available on a single `ws` connection.

[source, js]
----
const ws = Ws(url, options)
----

==== connect
Initiate the connection

[source, js]
----
ws.connect()
----

==== close
Forcefully close the connection. After this, all subscription will removed and no reconnection will be triggered.

[source, js]
----
ws.close()
----

==== getSubscription(topic)
Returns instance of a subscription for a given topic. If there is no subscription `null` will be returned.

[source, js]
----
ws.subscribe('chat')

ws.getSubscription('chat').on('message', () => {
})
----

==== subscribe(topic)
Subscribe to a topic. Subscribing to the same topic twice, will raise an exception.

[source, js]
----
const chat = ws.subscribe('chat')
----

== Authentication
The JavaScript client makes it super easy to authenticate users. The auth credentials are only passed once to the server, during the initial connection and then same information can be reused to allow or disallow channel subscriptions.

NOTE: If you are using sessions, then user will be authenticated automatically, if they have a valid session.

==== withBasicAuth(username, password)
Authenticate user using basic auth

[source, js]
----
const ws = Ws(url, options)

ws
  .withBasicAuth(username, password)
  .connect()
----

==== withApiToken(token)
Authenticate user using api token

[source, js]
----
const ws = Ws(url, options)

ws
  .withApiToken(token)
  .connect()
----

==== withJwtToken(token)
Authenticate user using JWT token

[source, js]
----
const ws = Ws(url, options)

ws
  .withJwtToken(token)
  .connect()
----

On the server, you can access the user information from the `auth` object.

NOTE: You must setup required middleware before running the following code. Learn more about link:websocket-server#_registering_middleware[middleware]

[source, js]
----
Ws.channel('chat', ({ auth }) => {
  console.log(auth.user)
})
----

In order to enforce authenticated connections, make sure to define the named middleware.

[source, js]
----
Ws.channel('chat', ({ auth }) => {
  console.log(auth.user)
}).middleware(['auth'])
----
