AdonisJs has a 1st party provider built on top of link:https://github.com/Slynova-Org/node-flydrive[Flydrive] to interact with local disk and remote file systems like *s3*. In this guide, we learn about setting up the provider and making use of it.

== Setup
Since the drive provider is not installed by default, we need to pull it from npm.

NOTE: Installing the provider via `adonis` command will setup the config file for you automatically.

[source, bash]
----
adonis install @adonisjs/drive
----

Next, we need to register the provider inside `start/app.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const providers = [
  '@adonisjs/drive/providers/DriveProvider'
]
----

== Available drivers
The only available drivers shipped by default are:

[ol-shrinked]
1. S3 ( s3 ) (You need to install `aws-sdk` package to be able to use this driver)
2. DigitalOcean Spaces (spaces) (You need to install `aws-sdk` package to be able to use this driver)
2. Local ( local )

== Basic Example
Let's start with the basic example of interacting the local file system using the Adonis repl.

== Drive API
The API of the drive is majorly based upon driver you are using to interact with the file system. However, for common operations like `write` and `read`, it remains the same.

==== exists(relativePath)
Find if a file/directory exists or not.

[source, js]
----
const exists = await Drive.exists('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== get(relativePath, encoding = utf-8)
Get file contents as a buffer or a string.

[source, js]
----
const unicorn = await Drive.get('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== getStream(relativePath)
Get file as a stream

[source, js]
----
Drive.getStream('hello.txt')
----

==== put(relativePath, content, options = {})
Create a new file with given contents. This method will create the missing directories.

[source, js]
----
await Drive.put('hello.txt', Buffer.from('Hello world!'))
----

==== prepend(relativePath, content, options = {})
Prepend content to an exisiting file. If file is missing, this method will create a new file.

NOTE: Only works with local driver

[source, js]
----
await Drive.prepend('hello.txt', Buffer.from('Hello everyone!'))
----

==== append(relativePath, content, options = {})
Append content to an exisiting file. If file is missing, this method will create a new file.

NOTE: Only works with local driver

[source, js]
----
await Drive.append('hello.txt', Buffer.from('Hello everyone!'))
----

==== delete(relativePath)
Remove existing file.

[source, js]
----
await Drive.delete('hello.txt')
----

==== move(src, dest, options = {})
Move file from one directory to another.

[source, js]
----
await Drive.move('hello.txt', 'hi.txt')
----

==== copy(src, dest, options = {})
Copy file from one directory to another.

[source, js]
----
await Drive.copy('hi.txt', 'hello.txt')
----

== S3 specific methods
Below is the list of methods that works for `s3` driver only.

==== getObject(location, params)
Get s3 object for a given file. Params is the list of link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getObject-property[S3 params].

[source, js]
----
await Drive.disk('s3').getObject('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== getUrl(location, [bucket])
Get URL to a file from the s3 bucket. Optionally you can define a different bucket too.

[source, js]
----
const url = Drive.disk('s3').getUrl('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== getSignedUrl(location, expiry = 900, params)
Get signed url to a given file. By default the expiry is set to `15mins`.

[source, js]
----
const url = await Drive.disk('s3').getSignedUrl('unicorn.jpg')
----
