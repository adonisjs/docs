= Public Files

toc::[]

AdonisJS can serve static assets and public files

NOTE: It would be better to use a CDN or a reverse proxy(i.e Nginx or Apache) to serve static files.

== Setup

To serve public files, the `Adonis/Middleware/Static` server middleware must be enabled in the file `start/kernel.js`.

.start/kernel.js
[source, js]
----
const serverMiddleware = [
  'Adonis/Middleware/Static',
]
----

All files in `public` folder will be served as static files

== Config
Static files configuration is in `config/app.js` and accepts the following options.

=== dotfiles
Define how to treat dot files when trying to server static resources.

You can return one of the following values:

[ul-spaced]
- "ignore" - will ignore dot files and throw not found 404 error
- "deny" - will deny access to dot files and throw forbidden 403 error
- "allow" - will allow access to dot files

=== etag
Enable or disable etag header generation

It can be set to boolean `true` or `false`


=== extensions
Set file extension fallbacks.

When set, if a file is not found, the given
extensions will be added to the file name and search for. The first
that exists will be served

It can be set to array of strings.

Example value: ['html', 'htm']

When there is file `hello-world.html` inside `public` folder visiting http://localhost:3333/hello-world would return `hello-world.html`
