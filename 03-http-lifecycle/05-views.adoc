AdonisJs makes use link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/[Edge.js, window="_blank"] as the templating engine, which is blazing fast and comes with an elegant API to create dynamic views.

Under the hood, Edge supports.
[ol-shrinked]
1. Layouts & partials
2. Components
3. Runtime debugging using chrome devtools
4. Logical tags and everything in between.

== Basic example
Let's start with the basic example of saying *Hello world* by rendering an edge template. All of the views are stored inside `resources/views` directory and ends with `.edge` extension.

As always you can use the `adonis` command to create the view.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:view home
----

Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  resources/views/home.edge
----

And let's create a route to render the `home.edge` view.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', ({ view }) => {
  return view.render('home')
})
----

The `view.render` method takes the relative path to view the file. There is no need to type `.edge` extension, since that is obvious.

Also, you can render views from the sub folders with dot notation.

[source, js]
----
// file path - users/list.edge

view.render('users.list')
----

== Request information
All views have access to the current `request` object by default. Which means you can call all request methods within the views as well.

[source, edge]
----
The request url is {{ request.url() }}
----

Also, there is a helper to get the URL.

[source, edge]
----
The request URL is {{ url }}
----

== Globals
All of the edge.js link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/globals[globals] are supported as it is. Here is the list of globals specific to AdonisJs only.

==== css
Add `link` tag to a css file. The file name should be relative from the `public` directory.

[source, edge]
----
{{ css('style') }}
----

Or
[source, edge]
----
{{ css('https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/css/bootstrap.min.css') }}
----

==== script
Adds a script tag to the document

[source, edge]
----
{{ script('app') }}
----

==== assetsUrl
Returns path of a file relative from the `public` directory.

[source, edge]
----
<img src="{{ assetsUrl('logo.png') }}" />
----

==== route
Get actual url for a route

Expecting the route to be registered as following

[source, js]
----
Route.get('users/:id', 'UserController.show').as('profile')
----

[source, edge]
----
<a href="{{ route('profile', { id: 1 }) }}">
  View profile
</a>
----

Also, you can use the controller method name.

[source, edge]
----
<a href="{{ route('UserController.show', { id: 1 }) }}">
  View profile
</a>
----

==== url
The current request url

[source, js]
----
The request URL is {{ url }}
----

==== auth
If you are using the auth provider, then you can access the current logged in user using the `auth` object.

[source, js]
----
{{ auth.user }}
----

== Tags
link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/tags[Tags, window="_blank"] are building blocks for edge templates. For example: `@if`, `@each` all are the tags shipped with the edge by default.

Also, edge exposes a very powerful API to add new tags to it. Here is a list of the `tags` specific to AdonisJs only.

==== loggedIn
The `loggedIn` tag allows you to write `if/else` clause around the logged in user. For example:

[source, edge]
----
@loggedIn
  <h2> You are logged in </h2>
@else
  <p> <a href="/login">Click here</a> to login </p>
@endloggedIn
----

Everything inside `@loggedIn` tag will be executed when the user is logged in.

==== inlineSvg
Render an svg file inline inside the HTML. The tag expects the relative path to the file from the `public` directory.

[source, edge]
----
<a href="/login">
  @inlineSvg('lock')
  Login
</a>
----

== Templating
The templating syntax is same as the Edge. So make sure to read the link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/syntax-guide[edge documentation].

== Syntax highlighting
The plugins for the following editors are available to get syntax highlighting support for Edge.

1. For link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge-sublime-syntax[Sublime text].
2. For link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge-atom-syntax[Atom].
