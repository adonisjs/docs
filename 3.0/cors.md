Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a way to allow incoming HTTP requests from different domains. It is very common in AJAX requests where the browser will block all cross-domain requests if they are not allowed by the server. Read more about [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS).

## Setup

In AdonisJs, **CORS** is handled by a middleware. Just make sure it is added to the list of Global middleware.

##### app/Http/kernel.js

```javascript
const globalMiddleware = [
  ...,
  'Adonis/Middleware/Cors'
]
```

## Config

Settings for CORS is defined inside `config/cors.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  origin: false,
  methods: 'GET, PUT, POST',
  headers: true,
  exposeHeaders: false,
  credentials: false,
  maxAge: 90
}
```

#### origin

Origin can accept multiple values

1. To disallow all CORS requests simply set it `false`
2. To allow the same origin requests, set it to `true`.
3. You can define comma(,) separated origins.
4. Setting the value to a wildcard `*`, will allow all origins.
5. Finally, you can attach a callback and return one of the above values.

```javascript
origin: function (requestOrigin) {
	return requestOrigin === 'foo'
}
```

#### methods

Http methods/verbs to allow.

#### headers

As origin, headers also accept multiple values

1. To disable all headers set to `false`.
2. To allow all headers defined inside `Access-Control-Request-Headers` set it to `true`.
3. Allow a string of comma(,) separated custom headers. For example, Content-Type, Accepts.
4. Finally, a callback function.

```javascript
headers: function (requestedHeaders) {
	// Your code
}
```

#### exposeHeaders(optional)

Comma separated headers to expose as `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`.

#### credentials (optional)

Allow or disallow `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` using a boolean value.

#### maxAge (optional)

Sets `Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age` to defined max age.
