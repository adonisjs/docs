When getting started with any web framework, the first question one often ask is, *how to create data driven applications?*. By the end of this guide, you will learn how easy AdonisJs makes to interact with SQL databases.

TIP: Watch this video on youtube, if you prefer a Screencast over text.

== Setup
The database provider is not configured with the default application blueprint, but setting it up as simple as installing it from
npm.

[source, bash]
----
adonis install @adonisjs/lucid
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
✔ npm: Installed @adonisjs/lucid
create: config/database.js
----

Post installation, you would have seen a new webpage getting popped up in your browser. That is the minimal instructions you need to follow in order to setup the installed package.

Feel free to ignore the setup instructions and follow this guide instead.

=== Registering provider
As always we need to register the database provider inside `start/app.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const providers = [
  '@adonisjs/lucid/providers/LucidProvider'
]

const aceProviders = [
  '@adonisjs/lucid/providers/MigrationsProvider'
]
----

=== Configuration
The database package *(lucid)* supports all popular SQL databases out of the box. You can learn more about it link:[here]

By default the configuration file (config/database.js) makes use of `sqlite` database and needs a sqlite driver to be installed from npm.

[source, bash]
----
adonis install sqlite3
----

== Creating database tables
Now since the setup process has been completed, let's get started by creating a database table and run some queries to interact with it.

Creating database tables in AdonisJs is done via link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration[migrations, window="_blank"]. It is fine if you do not understand the concept of migrations properly, just follow along and you will find them super easy and useful.

More `adonis` ❤️  &nbsp; to create the migration. Also select the `Create table` option on prompt.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:migration BlogPost
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
✔ create  database/migrations/1502346098443_blog_post_schema.js
----

The created file gives you an interface to create the database table structure using JavaScript. Let's see it in action.

[source, js]
----
'use strict'

const Schema = use('Schema')

class BlogPostSchema extends Schema {
  up () {
    this.create('blog_posts', (table) => {
      table.increments()
      table.string('title')
      table.longText('body')
      table.timestamps()
    })
  }

  down () {
    this.drop('blog_posts')
  }
}

module.exports = BlogPostSchema
----

The migration file has two methods

up::
The `up` method is used to take the action on a table. It can be creating a new table or altering the existing up.

down::
The `down` method is the reverse of the up action. When `up` method creates a table, you simply drop it inside the down method.
+
The beauty of this approach, makes it easier to rollback the database changes.


Now finally we can run another command to create the table using the schema file we just updated.

[source, bash]
----
adonis migration:run
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
migrate: 1502346098443_blog_post_schema.js
Database migrated successfully in 86 ms
----

Let's take a moment to recap on what we did so far.

1. We installed `@adonisjs/lucid` package from npm and registered the required providers.
2. Next, used the migrations feature to create a schema file and migrated the database.

== Using database
Let's see how we can use the *Database provider* to fetch all the blog posts from database.

.start/routes.js
[source, js]
----
const Database = use('Database')
const Route = use('Route')

Route.get('/posts', async () => {
  return await Database.table('blog_posts').select('*')
})
----

Assuming the web server is running on `port=3333`. If you visit link:http://localhost:3333/posts[localhost:3333/posts], you will see an empty array being returned, that's because we have not saved any posts inside the database table.

== Saving posts
The ideal way is to have an HTML form to create the posts, but for the sake the simplicity, we will take a shortcut and use the *Adonis repl* to interact with the database.

=== What is repl?
AdonisJs has an in-built command line repl, which can be used to interact with your application from command line. Let's see it in action to create a post.

The following command will start the repl session and you are free to run Node.js code inside it.

[source, bash]
----
adonis repl
----

And paste the following code inside it

[source, bash]
----
await use('Database').table('blog_posts').insert({ title: 'Adonis 101', body: 'some description' })
----

Checkout the following gif to see it in action

Now if you refresh the browser link:http://localhost:3333/posts[localhost:3333/posts] you will see the recently created blog post being returned as JSON.
