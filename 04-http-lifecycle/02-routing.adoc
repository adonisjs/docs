toc::[]

AdonisJs routing favors *REST conventions*, but still, give enough room to create and register custom routes. In this guide, we learn about creating routes, binding controller methods and different ways to organize them.

All of the application routes are registered inside `start/routes.js` file. Also, you are free to create multiple files for routes and just require them inside the `routes.js` file.

== Basic example
The most basic route requires a URL path and closure to be executed. The returned value from the closure is sent back as the response.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', () => 'Hello world')
----

After starting the server using `adonis serve --dev`, if you visit link:http://localhost:3333[localhost:3333], you see the *Hello world* in the browser.

== Route methods/verbs
Restful routes make use of different HTTP methods to indicate the type of request. For example: `POST` method is used to create a record and `GET` is used to fetch record(s).

You can define routes for different HTTP methods using one of the following methods.

==== get
Create a route with GET method.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', async () => {
})
----

==== post
Create a route with POST method.

[source, js]
----
Route.post('/', async () => {
})
----

==== put/patch
The `PUT` and `PATCH` methods are used to update a resource.

[source, js]
----
Route.put('/', async () => {
})

Route.patch('/', async () => {
})
----

==== delete
The `DELETE` method indicates removing a resource.

[source, js]
----
Route.delete('/', async () => {
})
----

==== route
Also, you can create routes that respond to multiple verbs using the `Route.route` method.

[source, js]
----
Route.route('/', async () => {

}, ['GET', 'POST'])
----

== Route parameters
Creating routes with static paths are not quite helpful, and often you need a way to accept dynamic data as part of the URL, for example:

[source, bash]
----
/posts/1
/posts/2
/posts/300
----

You would need a way to fetch the post id from the URL and render the appropriate post. The same is achieved by defining route parameters.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('posts/:id', async ({ params }) => {
  const post = await Post.find(params.id)
  return post
})
----

The `:id` is a route parameter which is passed as part of the `params` object. Also, you can make it optional by adding `?` to the parameter. For example:

[source, js]
----
Route.get('make/:drink?', async ({ params }) => {
  // use Coffee as fallback when drink is not defined
  const drink = params.drink || 'Coffee'

  return `Will make ${drink} for you`
})
----

== Routing for SPA's
Quite often you find yourself creating a SPA ( single page application ), where you want to render a single view from the server and handle routing on front-end using your favorite front end framework.

This can be done by defining a wildcard route.

[source, js]
----
Route.any('*', ({ view }) => view.render('main'))
----

If you have any other specific routes, they are be defined before the wildcard route. For example:

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/api/v1/users', 'UserController.index')

// wildcard route
Route.any('*', ({ view }) => view.render('main'))
----

== Binding controllers
Defining closures as the route actions are not scalable, since writing all the code inside a single file is never desired and neither practical.

AdonisJs being an MVC framework offers a nice abstractions layer called *Controllers* to keep all the request handling logic inside custom ES6 classes.

Let's create a controller using the `make:controller` command.
[source, bash]
----
adonis make:controller Posts
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  app/Controllers/Http/PostController.js
----

The next step is to bind the controller method to the route. It is defined as a `dot (.)` separated string.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('posts', 'PostController.index')
----
Finally, we need to create the `index` method on the controller class.

[source, js]
----
'use strict'

class PostController {
  index () {
    return 'Dummy response'
  }
}

module.exports = PostController
----

== Route middleware
You can apply selected middleware to routes by calling the `middleware` method.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .get('profile', 'UserController.profile')
  .middleware(['auth'])
----

The `middleware` method accepts an array of named middleware, which is defined inside `start/kernel.js` file.

.start/kernel.js
[source, js]
----
const namedMiddleware = {
  auth: 'Adonis/Middleware/Auth'
}
----

Click link:middleware[here] to learn more about middleware.

== Named routes
Routes are defined inside `start/routes.js` file but referenced everywhere inside your application. For example: Defining a form action to submit to a particular URL.

[source, js]
----
Route.post('users', 'UserController.store')
----

Inside the template

[source, edge]
----
<form method="POST" action="/users">
</form>
----

Now if you change your route path from `/users` to something else, you have to remember to come back and change it inside the template as-well.

To overcome this problem, you can name your routes uniquely and reference them in other part of the program.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .post('users', 'UserController.store')
  .as('storeUser')
----

The `as` method gives your route a name. Now inside your template, you can reference it using a view global.

[source, edge]
----
<form method="POST" action="{{ route('storeUser') }}">
</form>
----

== Route formats
Route formats open up a new way for link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation[Content negotiation, window="_blank"], where you can accept the response format as part of the URL.

Route format is a contract between the client and the server on which type of response to be created. For example:

[source, js]
----
Route
  .get('users', async ({ request, view }) => {
    const users = await User.all()

    if (request.format() === 'json') {
      return users
    } else {
      return view.render('users.list', { users })
    }

  })
  .formats(['json'])
----

Now the `users` endpoint can respond in multiple formats, based upon the URL.

/users.json::
Return an array of users in JSON.

/users::
Render the view and returns HTML

Also, you can disable the default URL and always force the client to define the format.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .get('/', async ({ request, view }) => {
    const users = await User.all()
    const format = request.format()

    switch (format) {
      case 'html':
        return view.render('users.list', { users })
      case 'json':
        return users
    }
  })
  .formats(['json', 'html'], true)
----

Passing `true` as the second parameter makes sure that the client defines one of the expected formats. Otherwise, a 404 is thrown.

== Route resources
If you like building web apps around REST conventions then *route resources* helps you in defining conventional routes by writing less code.

NOTE: It is required to bind a *Controller* to the resource. Binding a closure throws an exception.

[source, js]
----
Route.resource('users', 'UsersController')
----

The `Route.resource` method under the hood creates a total of 7 routes

[role="resource-table", options="header", cols="40%, 10%, 25%, 25%"]
|===
| Url | Verb  | Name | Controller Method
| users [description]#Show a list of all the users# | GET | users.index | `UsersController.index`
| users/create [description]#Render a form to be used for creating a new user# | GET  | users.create | `UsersController.create`
| users [description]#Create/save a new user.# | POST | users.store | `UsersController.store`
| users/:id [description]#Display a single user# | GET | users.show | `UsersController.show`.
| users/:id/edit [description]#Render a form to update an existing user.# | GET | users.edit | `UsersController.edit`
| users/:id [description]#Update user details.# | PUT or PATCH | users.update | `UsersController.update`
| users/:id [description]#Delete a user with id.# | DELETE | users.destroy | `UsersController.destroy`
|===

Nested resources can be created with `dot (.)` notation.

[source, js]
----
Route.resource('posts.comments', 'CommentsController')
----

=== Filtering resources
You can limit the number of routes a resource should create by chaining handful of methods.

==== apiOnly
Limit the routes to only 5 by removing `users/create` and `users/:id/edit`. Since when writing an API server, you may want to render the forms within the API consumer (e.g., a mobile app, frontend web framework, etc.).

[source, js]
----
Route
  .resource('users', 'UsersController')
  .apiOnly()
----

==== only([names])
Remove all other routes but not the ones passed to the `only` method.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .resource('users', 'UsersController')
  .only(['index', 'show'])
----

==== except([names])
Remove route for names passed to the `except` method.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .resource('users', 'UsersController')
  .except(['index', 'show'])
----

=== Resource Middleware
You can attach middleware to the resource, just like you would do to a single route.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .resource('users', 'UsersController')
  .middleware(['auth'])
----

Since attaching auth middleware to all the routes is not always desired, you can customize the behavior by passing a map of values.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .resource('users', 'UsersController')
  .middleware(new Map([
    ['auth']: ['users.store', 'users.update', 'users.delete']
  ]))
----

Here we have defined the `auth` middleware on *store*, *update* and *delete* routes.

=== Resource Formats
Also, you can define the formats for all the resourceful routes, just like the way you do for a single route or a group of routes.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .resource('users', 'UsersController')
  .formats(['json'])
----

== Routing domains
AdonisJs makes it super easy to serve multiple domains within a single codebase. The domains can be static endpoints like `blog.adonisjs.com` or dynamic endpoints like `:user.adonisjs.com`.

TIP: You can define the domain on a single route as well, but it is a good idea to group domain specific routes.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .group(() => {
    Route.get('users', async ({ subdomains }) => {
      return `The username is ${subdomains.user}`
    })
  })
  .domain(':user.myapp.com')
----

Now if you visit `virk.myapp.com`, You see the above route is executed.

== Route groups
Quite often your application routes share common logic/configuration around them. So instead of re-defining the configuration on each route, it's better to group them. For example:

Not desired
[source, js]
----
Route.get('/api/v1/users', 'UserController.index')
Route.post('/api/v1/users', 'UserController.store')
----

Instead, we can make use of the route's group here.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .group(() => {
    Route.get('users', 'UserController.index')
    Route.post('users', 'UserController.store')
  })
  .prefix('api/v1')
----

Just like the `prefix` method, you can call the following methods on a group of routes.

==== middleware
Define middleware on a group of routes. All group middleware are executed before the middleware defined on a single route.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .group(() => {
  })
  .middleware(['auth'])
----

==== domain
Specify routes on a group of routes.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .group(() => {
  })
  .domain('blog.adonisjs.com')
----

==== formats
Define formats on a group of routes.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .group(() => {
  })
  .formats(['json', 'html'])
----

== Route Renderer
Route renderer is a one liner to render a view without creating a controller method or binding a closure.

Instead of following

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', async function ({ view }) {
  return view.render('welcome')
})
----

We can write

[source, js]
----
Route.on('/').render('welcome')
----
