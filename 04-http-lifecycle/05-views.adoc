AdonisJs makes use link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/[Edge.js, window="_blank"] as the templating engine, which is blazing fast and comes with an elegant API to create dynamic views.

Under the hood, Edge supports.
[ol-shrinked]
1. Layouts & partials
2. Components
3. Runtime debugging using chrome dev tools
4. Logical tags and everything in between.

== Basic example
Let's start with the basic example of saying *Hello world* by rendering an edge template. All of the views are stored inside `resources/views` directory and ends with `.edge` extension.

NOTE: Make sure that the `ViewProvider` is registered as a provider inside `start/app.js` file.
[source, js]
----
const providers = [
  '@adonisjs/framework/providers/ViewProvider'
]
----

As always you can use the `adonis` command to create the view.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:view home
----

Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  resources/views/home.edge
----

So let's create a route to render the `home.edge` view.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', ({ view }) => {
  return view.render('home')
})
----

The `view.render` method takes the relative path to the view file. There is no need to type `.edge` extension, since that is obvious.

Also, you can render views from the sub folders with dot notation.

[source, js]
----
// file path - users/list.edge

view.render('users.list')
----

== Request information
All views have access to the current `request` object, and you can call request methods inside your templates as well.

[source, edge]
----
The request URL is {{ request.url() }}
----

Also, there is a helper to get the URL.

[source, edge]
----
The request URL is {{ url }}
----

== Globals
All of the edge.js link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/globals[globals] are supported as it is. Here is the list of globals specific to AdonisJs only.

==== css
Add `link` tag to a CSS file. The file name should be relative from the `public` directory.

[source, edge]
----
{{ css('style') }}
----

Or
[source, edge]
----
{{ css('https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/css/bootstrap.min.css') }}
----

==== script
Adds a script tag to the document

[source, edge]
----
{{ script('app') }}
----

==== assetsUrl
Returns path of a file relative from the `public` directory.

[source, edge]
----
<img src="{{ assetsUrl('logo.png') }}" />
----

==== route
Get actual URL for a route

Expecting the route to be registered as following

[source, js]
----
Route.get('users/:id', 'UserController.show').as('profile')
----

[source, edge]
----
<a href="{{ route('profile', { id: 1 }) }}">
  View profile
</a>
----

Also, you can use the controller method name.

[source, edge]
----
<a href="{{ route('UserController.show', { id: 1 }) }}">
  View profile
</a>
----

==== url
The current request url

[source, edge]
----
The request URL is {{ url }}
----

==== auth
If you are using the auth provider, then you can access the current logged in user using the `auth` object.

[source, edge]
----
{{ auth.user }}
----

==== csrfField
If you are using the `shield` middleware, you can access the csrfToken and field using one of the following methods.

[source, edge]
----
{{ csrfToken }}
----

[source, edge]
----
{{ csrfField() }}
----

Outputs

[source, html]
----
<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="..." />
----

==== cspMeta
When using shield middleware, the CSP headers are set automatically. However can also set them using HTML meta tag.

[source, edge]
----
<head>
  {{ cspMeta() }}
</head>
----

== Tags
link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/tags[Tags, window="_blank"] are building blocks for edge templates. For example: `@if`, `@each` all are the tags shipped with the edge by default.

Also, edge exposes a very powerful API to add new tags to it. Here is a list of the `tags` specific to AdonisJs only.

==== loggedIn
The `loggedIn` tag allows you to write `if/else` clause around the logged in user. For example:

[source, edge]
----
@loggedIn
  <h2> You are logged in </h2>
@else
  <p> <a href="/login">Click here</a> to login </p>
@endloggedIn
----

Everything inside `@loggedIn` tag gets executed when the user is logged in.

==== inlineSvg
Render an SVG file inline inside the HTML. The tag expects the relative path to the file from the `public` directory.

[source, edge]
----
<a href="/login">
  @inlineSvg('lock')
  Login
</a>
----

== Templating
The templating syntax is same as the Edge. So make sure to read the link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/syntax-guide[edge documentation, window="_blank"].

== Extending views
You can also extend views by adding your view globals or tags.

NOTE: Since the code to extend the `View` needs to be executed once, you can make use of providers or ignitor hooks. Make sure to read link:[how to extend] guide before continuing.

=== Globals
[source, js]
----
const View = use('View')
View.global('currentTime', function () {
  return new Date().getTime()
})
----

Above global returns the current time when you reference it inside the views.

[source, edge]
----
{{ currentTime() }}
----

=== Globals scope
The value of `this` inside globals closure is bound to the view context so that you can access runtime values from it.

[source, js]
----
View.global('button', function (text) {
  return this.safe(`<button type="submit"> ${text} </button>`)
})
----

The `safe` method makes sure that returned HTML is not escaped.

To use other global methods or values, make use of the `this.resolve` method.

[source, js]
----
View.global('messages', {
  success: 'This is a success message',
  warning: 'This is a warning message'
})

View.global('getMessage', function (type) {
  const message = this.resolve('messages')
  return messages[type]
})
----

[source, edge]
----
{{ getMessage('success') }}
----

=== Tags
Learn more about tags from the link:http://edge.adonisjs.com/docs/tags[Edge docs, window="_blank"].

[source, js]
----
const View = use('View')

class MyTag extends View.engine.BaseTag {
}

View.engine.tag(new MyTag())
----

=== Runtime values
Quite often you want to share request specific values with your views, and same can be done by creating a middleware and sharing locals.

[source, js]
----
class SomeMiddleware {

  async handle ({ view }, next) {
    view.share({
      apiVersion: request.input('version')
    })

    await next()
  }
}
----

Moreover, inside your views, you can access it like any other value

[source, edge]
----
{{ apiVersion }}
----

== Syntax highlighting
The plugins for the following editors are available to get syntax highlighting support for Edge.
