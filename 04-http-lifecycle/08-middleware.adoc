toc::[]

The HTTP middleware are a set of functions executed in sequence, one after the other. The concept of a sequential chain makes it powerful to transform the request or end it at any stage.

Features like *sessions*, *authentication* make extensive use of the middleware to add features to the framework.

Middleware can perform one/all of the following operations

[ol-shrinked]
1. Decorate HTTP context and add values to it.
2. Respond to a given request, without reaching the route action.
3. Deny requests by throwing errors.

== Using Middleware
All of the middleware are registered inside `start/kernel.js` file and separated into 2 different categories.

=== Global middleware
The global middleware are executed for each request that has a registered route and defined under the `globalMiddleware` array.

NOTE: Middleware are executed in the sequence they are defined.

[source, js]
----
const globalMiddleware = [
  'Adonis/Middleware/BodyParser'
]
----

=== Named middleware
Named middleware is an object of key/value pairs, and you can define the keys to individual routes or a group of routes to apply certain middleware.

Named middleware are used, when you want to perform certain actions on selected routes only.

[source, js]
----
const named = {
  auth: 'Adonis/Middleware/Auth'
}
----

Later you can use the `auth` key on your Routes.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .get('users/:id', 'UserController.show')
  .middleware(['auth'])
----

Also, you can apply multiple middleware to a route, and they are executed in the sequence they are passed.

=== Middleware Props
To keep middleware configurable at runtime, AdonisJs makes it possible to pass *props to named middleware*. For example: Using the auth middleware with different authentication scheme for different routes. Props will be available as the third argument in middleware's `handle` method.

TIP: Middleware uses the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/haye#pipe-expression[pipe expression, window="_blank"] to define props.

[source, js]
----
Route
  .post('users', 'UsersController.store')
  .middleware(['auth:session'])
----

And

[source, js]
----
Route
  .post('posts', 'PostsController.store')
  .middleware(['auth:jwt'])
----

Multiple props can be passed as `auth:session,jwt`.

== Creating Middleware
You can also create middleware to add application specific logic to the HTTP lifecycle. All project related middleware are stored inside `app/Middleware` directory.

You can use the `adonis` command to create a middleware for you.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:middleware CountryDetector
----

Output
[source, js]
----
âœ” create  app/Middleware/CountryDetector.js
----

=== Creating middleware
Now let's say we want to use the user ip address and detect their country. We can write all that code inside the `handle` method of the middleware.

[source, js]
----
'use strict'

const geoip = use('geoip-lite')

class CountryDetector {
  async handle ({ request }, next) {
    const ip = request.ip()
    request.country = geoip.lookup(ip).country
    await next()
  }
}

module.exports = CountryDetector
----

=== Registering middleware
Let's register this as a global middleware so that we can fetch country for all the users.

.start/kernel.js
[source, js]
----
const globalMiddleware = [
  'App/Middleware/CountryDetector'
]
----

That is all ðŸ˜Ž &nbsp; Now all of your requests have the `country` property on it.
