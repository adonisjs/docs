= Handling Exceptions

toc::[]

AdonisJs not only treats exceptions as a way to guide the developer on what went wrong but also as a way to build application flow around them.

In this guide, we learn how exceptions are raised, how to write logic around them and finally creating your custom exceptions.

== Introduction
Exceptions are great since they halt the program at a certain stage and makes sure that everything is correct before proceeding.

Usually, exceptions are just considered as a bunch of text, to tell the developer about what went wrong. If handled carefully they can help you build application flow around it.

By default, AdonisJs handles all the exceptions for you and display them in a link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/v1485520687/Screen_Shot_2017-01-27_at_6.07.28_PM_blcaau.png[nice format, window="_blank"] during development. However, you are free to handle exceptions of your own.

// NOTE: Watch this link:[video] to learn more on how to structure application around *custom exceptions*.

== Handling exceptions
Exceptions can be handled by binding a *wildcard* exception handler or handling individual exceptions using their names.

Let's start with the wildcard handler by creating an exception handler using the `adonis` command line tool.

=== Wildcard handler
[source, bash]
----
adonis make:ehandler
----

Output
[source, bash]
----
✔ create  app/Exceptions/Handler.js
----

Once you create this file, AdonisJs hands over all the exceptions occurred during HTTP lifecycle to it.
[source, js]
----
const BaseExceptionHandler = use('BaseExceptionHandler')

class ExceptionHandler extends BaseExceptionHandler {
  async handle (error, { response, session }) {
    if (error.name === 'ValidationException') {
      session.withErrors(error.messages).flashAll()
      await session.commit()
      response.redirect('back')
      return
    }

    return super.handle(...arguments)
  }
}

module.exports = ExceptionHandler
----

The `handle` method in this class handles the `ValidationException` differently by flashing the errors back to the form.

=== Individual exceptions
Also, you can hook into individual exceptions by defining an inline exception handler for them. The same can be done inside the `start/hooks.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const { hooks } = require('@adonisjs/ignitor')

hooks.after.providersBooted(() => {
  const Exception = use('Exception')

  Exception.handle('ValidationException', async (error, { response, session }) => {
    session.withErrors(error.messages).flashAll()
    await session.commit()
    response.redirect('back')
    return
  })
})
----

== Custom exceptions
We learned how to handle certain exceptions with their names. Also, Adonisjs makes it so simple to build your custom exceptions and define handlers for them.

All the exceptions are stored inside `app/Exceptions` folder and as always let's use the `adonis` command to create an exception.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:exception Custom
----

Output
[source, bash]
----
✔ create  app/Exceptions/CustomException.js
----

[source, js]
----
const GE = require('@adonisjs/generic-exceptions')

class CustomException extends GE.LogicalException {
}

module.exports = CustomException
----

Now you can throw this exception just by importing the exceptions file. The `status` and `code` are optional when throwing the exception.

[source, js]
----
const CustomException = use('App/Exceptions/CustomException')

throw new CustomException(message, status, code)
----

The beauty of this approach is that you can give a unique name to your exceptions as the `class name` and then catch them accordingly.

=== A step further
Also, we can take a step further and define the `handle` and `report` methods on the exception itself. AdonisJs makes sure to call them if they exist.

[source, js]
----
class CustomException extends GE.LogicalException {
  handle (error, { response }) {
    response.status(500).send('Some message')
  }
}

module.exports = CustomException
----

Throwing the above exception calls the `handle` method on the exception itself to handle it.
