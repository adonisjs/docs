= Upgrading from 4.0

toc::[]

The 4.1 release contains bunch of *bug fixes* and *API improvements* to keep the code base simple and less magical. I tried to keep the breaking changes as few as possible, however cannot eliminate them completely.

== Getting started

The first step is to get the latest version of all dependencies. I personally use link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates[npm-check-updates] to pull latest versions of packages.

[source, bash]
----
npm install -g npm-check-updates
----

Next, run the following command to update the `package.json` file with the latest versions of each dependency.

[source, bash]
----
ncu -a
----

Finally, remove the `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` and re-install dependencies.

[source, bash]
----
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules

# install
npm i
----

== Exception handling
