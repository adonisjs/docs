= Hooks

toc::[]

Hooks are the actions you perform before or after a specified database operation. Hooks plays a major role in keeping your code base DRY and easy to reason about.

For example: *Hashing* the user password before saving it to the database.

== Defining hooks
Hooks can be defined inline within the Model class or by referencing a `file.method` from the *Hooks* directory.

=== Binding closure
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')
const Hash = use('Hash')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()

    this.addHook('beforeCreate', async (userInstance) => {
      userInstance.password = await Hash.make(userInstance.password)
    })
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

Now every time we create a user, the `beforeCreate` hook closure is executed with the current instance of the user and hashes the password.

=== Hook file
It is always nice to keep extracted pieces of code into their files. AdonisJs comes with a dedicated directory `app/Models/Hooks` to store model hooks.

Let's use `adonis make:hook` command to create a hook for us.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:hook User
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  app/Models/Hooks/UserHook.js
----

Let's open the created file and move the code to hash the password inside it.

[source, js]
----
'use strict'

const Hash = use('Hash')

const UserHook = exports = module.exports = {}

UserHook.hashPassword = async (user) => {
  user.password = await Hash.make(user.password)
}
----

Now we can remove the inline code from the model and instead reference this file and method.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()
    this.addHook('beforeCreate', 'UserHook.hashPassword')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

== Aborting Database Operations
Hooks can also abort the database operations by throwing exceptions.

.app/Models/Hooks/User.js
[source, javascript]
----
UserHook.validate = async (user) => {
  if (!user.username) {
    throw new Error('Username is required')
  }
}
----

== Lifecycle Events
Below is the list of life cycle events and their description

[options="header"]
|====
| Event | Description
| beforeCreate | Before creating a new row.
| afterCreate | After a new record is created.
| beforeUpdate | Before updating a row.
| afterUpdate | After a row has been created.
| beforeSave | This event occurs before *creating* or *updating* a new record.
| afterSave | After a new record has been *created* or *updated*.
| beforeDelete | Before removing a row.
| afterDelete | After a row is removed.
| afterFind | After a single row is fetched from the database.
| afterFetch | After the `fetch` method is executed. The hook method receives an array of the model instances.
