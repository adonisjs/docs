Traits make it possible to add functionality to your Models from *outside-in*. Think of them as building blocks for your models.

Using traits, you can

[ol-shrinked]
1. Add new methods to your model class.
2. Listen for model hooks.
3. Add methods to query builder instance for a given model.

== Traits signature
Traits are saved inside `app/Models/Traits` directory. Each trait must have a `register` method which receives the model class as the only parameter.

.app/Models/Traits/Slugify.js
[source, js]
----
class Slugify {

  register (Model) {
    Model.addHook('beforeCreate', function () {
      // create slug
    })
  }
}

module.exports = Slugify
----

Now, you can register the trait as following.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()
    this.addTrait('Slugify')
  }
}
----

== Extending query builder
Also, you can add macros to the `QueryBuilder` for a given model.

[source, js]
----
class Slugify {

  register (Model) {
    Model.queryMacro('whereSlug', function (value) => {
      this.where('slug', value)
      return this
    })
  }
}

module.exports = Slugify
----

Moreover, then use it as

[source, js]
----
await User.query().whereSlug('some value')
----
