# Response

The response object is also sent along with every single HTTP request and has a handful of methods to respond properly from a given request.

- [Making Response](#making-response)
- [Descriptive Methods](#descriptive-methods)
- [Cookies](#cookies)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Making Views](#making-views)

## Making Response

For the most basic response, you can make use of send method

``` javascript,line-numbers
* index (request, response) {
  response.send("Hello world")
}
```

#### send (body)

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.send("Hello world")
```

#### status (statusCode)

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.status(200).send("Hello world")
```

#### json (body)

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.json({drink:"coffee"})
```

#### jsonp (body)

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.jsonp({drink:"coffee"})
```

#### vary (field)

adds vary header to response

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.vary('Accept')
```

#### header (key, value)

adds key/value pair to response header

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
```

## Descriptive Methods

Response object has support for descriptive methods, which will auto set the response status for you.

<div class="__note">

â€‹	<strong> Note: </strong> Descriptive methods have been introduced in version `2.0.9`.

</div>

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.ok('Done')
// is equivalent to response.status(200).send('Done')
response.unauthorized('Login First')
// is equivalent to response.status(401).send('Login First')
```



Below is the list of supported methods and their correspoding http statuses.

## Cookies

You can also attach cookies to your response

#### cookie (key, value, [, options])

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.cookie('name', 'value')
// or
response.cookie('name', 'value', options)
```

**options**

| Property       | type    | description                              |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| path           | String  | cookie path                              |
| expires        | Date    | absolute expiration date for the cookie (Date object) |
| maxAge         | String  | relative max age of the cookie from when the client receives it (seconds) |
| domain         | String  | domain for the cookie                    |
| secure         | Boolean | Marks the cookie to be used with HTTPS only |
| httpOnly       | Boolean | Flags the cookie to be accessible only by the web server |
| firstPartyOnly | Boolean | Defines cookie to be used by the same domain only |

#### clearCookie (key [,options])

removes existing cookie from response

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.clearCookie('name')
```

## Redirects

Redirecting to a different path is a common requirement for a web application. As Adonis is a tightly integrated framework, you can leverage out of box redirection mechanisms.

#### redirect (url)

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.redirect('http://foo.com')
```

#### route

redirects to a given route

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.route('/user/:id', {id: 1})
```

or you can use the name for a named route.

``` javascript,line-numbers
Routes
.get('/user/:id','UsersController.show')
.as('profile')
```

``` javascript,line-numbers
response.route('profile', {id: 1})
```

## Making Views

Response class includes a helper to make views using response object.

#### view (path [, data])

``` javascript,line-numbers
const view = yield response.view('index')
response.send(view)

// or

const view = yield response.view('profile', {username: 'foo'})
response.send(view)
```



#### sendView (path [, data])

sendView is similar to `view` method, instead it will send the response immediately and you will not have to call `send` method manually.

``` javascript,line-numbers
const view = yield response.sendView('index')
// or
const view = yield response.sendView('profile', {username: 'foo'})
```
