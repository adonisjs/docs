= Relationships

toc::[]

Relationships are the backbone of data-driven apps. Whether it is about maintaining *posts* written by a given *author* or *cars* from a given *company*.

Lucid expressive API makes the process of associating and fetching these relations so straightforward and intuitive, without even touching the SQL schema.

== Basic example
Letâ€™s take the most common scenario of a User and a Profile model. Every user in your database can have a social profile. We call this a *one to one relationship*.

=== Defining relationship
To describe this relationship, you have to add following lines of code to your User model.

.app/Models/User.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Models/Profile')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

So we create a method on the `User` model, which returns a `hasOne` relationship with the profile model. Also let's create the `Profile` model too, to make this work.

NOTE: There is no need to define relationship on both the models. Setting it on a single model works as expected. Also, lucid relationships are not bound to SQL schema.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:model Profile
----

.app/Models/Profile.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Profile extends Model {
}

module.exports = Profile
----

=== Fetching user profile
Execute the following code to fetch the user profile as per the defined relationship.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)
const userProfile = await user.profile().fetch()
----

== Has One
The `hasOne` relationship defines a one to one relation using a `foreign key` to the other model.

Here is the list of parameters and you can override/define accordingly.

=== API
[source, js]
----
hasOne(relatedModel, primaryKey, foreignKey)
----

relateModel::
Should always be defined as an Ioc container reference to the other Lucid model.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the current model primary key.

foreignKey::
Defaults to `tableName_primaryKey` of the current model. The singular form of the table name is used.

=== Database tables

=== Defining relation
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Models/Profile')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----


== Has Many
The `hasMany` relationship defines a one to many relationships using a `foreign key` to the other model.

Here is the list of parameters and you can override/define accordingly.

=== API
[source, js]
----
hasMany(relatedModel, primaryKey, foreignKey)
----

relateModel::
Should always be defined as an Ioc container reference to the other Lucid model.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the current model primary key.

foreignKey::
Defaults to `tableName_primaryKey` of the current model. The singular form of the table name is used.

=== Database tables
link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900449/HasMany_kkbac9.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900449/HasMany_kkbac9.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining relation
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  posts () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Post')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

== Belongs To
The `belongsTo` relationship is similar to the xref:_has_one[hasOne] relationship, but instead, it is applied on the other end of the relation.

Let's continue with the example of *User* and *Profile*; the profile model has the `belongsTo` relationship.

=== API
[source, js]
----
belongsTo(relatedModel, primaryKey, foreignKey)
----

relateModel::
Should always be defined as an Ioc container reference to the other Lucid model.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the related model foreign key. Which is `user_id` in this case.

foreignKey::
Defaults to the related model primary key.

=== Database tables
link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900684/BelongsTo_fwqdc3.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900684/BelongsTo_fwqdc3.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining relation
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Profile extends Model {
  user () {
    return this.belongsTo('App/Models/User')
  }
}

module.exports = Profile
----

== Belongs To Many
The `belongsToMany` relationship is quite powerful since it allows you to define many to many relationships in both the models. For example

[ol-shrinked]
1. A *user* can have many *cars*.
2. Also a *car* can have many *owners* during its lifespan.

When defining this relationship, there is no simple way to store a foreign key, and instead, we rely on a `3rd table`
called *pivot table*.

NOTE: You have to create the `pivot_table` via migrations.

=== API
[source, js]
----
belongsToMany(
  relatedModel,
  foreignKey,
  relatedForeignKey,
  primaryKey,
  relatedPrimaryKey
)
----

relateModel::
Should always be defined as an Ioc container reference to the other Lucid model.

foreignKey::
The foreign key for the current model, which is `user_id` in this case.

relatedForeignKey::
The foreign key for the related model, which is `car_id`.

primaryKey::
Current model primary key. This defaults to `id`.

relatedPrimaryKey::
Related model primary key. This defaults to `id`.

=== Database Tables

link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502903344/BelongsToMany_ngg7oj.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502903344/BelongsToMany_ngg7oj.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining relation
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  cars () {
    return this.belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

The table called `car_user` is the pivot table, which holds a unique relationship between the *car* and the *user*.

==== pivotTable
You can also define a different table name by calling `pivotTable` method on the relationship.

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .pivotTable('user_cars')
}
----

==== withTimestamps
It is assumed that pivot table does not have timestamps. To enable timestamps, you must call `withTimestamps` table.

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .withTimestamps()
}
----

==== withPivot
When fetching the relationships, Lucid only selects the `foreign keys` from the pivot table. You can make it select other fields by calling `withPivot` method.

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .withPivot(['is_current_owner'])
}
----

==== pivotModel
If you want more control over the queries made to the pivot table, you can bind a pivot model. With pivot model in place, you can use *lifecycle hooks*, *define getters/setters*, etc.

NOTE: After defining `pivotModel`, you cannot call `pivotTable` and `withTimestamps` methods. Instead, you are required to set these values on the pivot model.

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .pivotModel('App/Models/UserCar')
}
----

`UserCar` is a regular Lucid model.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class UserCar extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()
    this.addHook('beforeCreate', (userCar) => {
      userCar.is_current_owner = true
    })
  }
}

module.exports = UserCar
----

== Many Through
The many through relationship is a convenient way to define an indirect relation. For example, A *user* belongs to a *country* and a *user* has many *posts*. Using many through, you can fetch all the *posts* for a given *country*.

=== API
[source, js]
----
manyThrough(
  relatedModel,
  relatedMethod,
  primaryKey,
  foreignKey
)
----

relateModel::
Should always be defined as an Ioc container reference to the other Lucid model.

relatedMethod::
The relationship method to be called on the related model to fetch the through results.

primaryKey::
Current model primary key. This defaults to `id`.

foreignKey::
The foreign key for the current model, which is `country_id`.

=== Database tables
link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502905066/HasManyThrough_dcr86k.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502905066/HasManyThrough_dcr86k.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining relations
The relationship needs to be defined on a couple of models. Let's continue with the *country posts* concept and define required relationships.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  posts () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Post')
  }
}
----

Now let's define the many through relationship.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Country extends Model {
  posts () {
    return this.manyThrough('App/Models/User', 'posts')
  }
}
----

NOTE: The `posts` parameter passed as the 2nd parameter is the reference to the `posts` method on the User model and is always required for a relationship to work.

== Querying data
Querying related data is pretty straight forward with the help of the intuitive API lucid offers. The API is consistent for all types of relationships.

Let's use the *user* and *posts* example.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)
const posts = await user.posts().fetch()
----

The above method fetches all the posts for the user with `id=1`.

You can also add runtime constraints by calling query builder methods as you would do with a typical query.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

// published posts
const posts = await user
  .posts()
  .where('is_published', true)
  .fetch()
----

Fetch all posts that are published and belongs to the user with `id=1`.

=== Querying pivot table
When working with a `belongsToMany` relationship, you can also add where clause on the pivot table.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

const cars = await user
  .cars()
  .wherePivot('is_current_owner', true)
  .fetch()
----

Fetch all the cars, where the user with `id=1` is the current owner car of the car. Also, you can make use of `orWherePivot` and `whereInPivot` methods as well.

== EagerLoading
Querying related data for a single entity is pretty simple, but when you want to fetch *posts* for more than one *user*, eager loading is something you should use.

Eager loading is a concept of fetching relationships with the minimum database queries possible. Let's say if we do not use *eager loading* for a while and rely on the previous technique.

.Not recommended
[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const users = await User.all()
const posts = []

for (let user of users) {
  const userPosts = await user.posts().fetch()
  posts.push(userPosts)
}
----

The above is the worst thing you can do. Since it makes *n+1* queries to the database, where *n* is the number of users. Also, all of the queries are made in sequence ðŸ˜¨

On the other hand, eager loading makes a total of 2 database queries to fetch all the users and their related posts.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts')
  .fetch()
----

The `with` method loads the relationship as part of the original payload and running `users.toJSON()` returns a similar output as following.

[source, js]
----
[
  {
    id: 1,
    username: 'virk',
    posts: [{
      id: 1,
      user_id: 1,
      title: '...'
    }]
  }
]
----

Also as you can see, the `posts` are defined as the user property, so it is easier to find which post belongs to which user.

=== Adding runtime constraints
It is so simple to add runtime constraints to the relationship.

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', true)
  })
  .fetch()
----

=== Loading multiple relations
The multiple relations can be loaded by chaining the `with` method.

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts')
  .with('profile')
  .fetch()
----

=== Loading nested relations
The nested relations are loaded with the help of *dot notation(.)* The following query loads all the *posts* with their related *comments*.

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts.comments')
  .fetch()
----

Passing a callback to `with` for a nested relationship is applied to the last relation. For example

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts.comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('approved', true)
  })
  .fetch()
----

The above `where` clause is applied to the `comments` relationship and not to the `posts`.

To add a constraint to the first relationship, do something as follows.
[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', true).with('comments')
  })
  .fetch()
----

This time we added a `where` clause to the `posts` relation and also eager loaded `comments` at the same time.

== Lazy eager loading
It is also possible to eagerload relationships after fetching the first set of data. For example: Loading `posts` after fetching the user.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.load('posts')
----

Also you can lazily eagerload multiple relationships as follows.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.loadMany(['posts', 'profiles'])
----

In order to pass query constraints, you must give an object.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.loadMany({
  posts: (builder) => builder.where('is_published', true),
  profiles: null
})
----

== Filtering data
The enrich API of Lucid makes it so simple to filter data based upon the relationship. Let's take a classic example of finding all those *posts* which has *comments*.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Post extends Model {
  comments () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Comments')
  }
}
----

==== has
Now let's add the filter to pull only those `posts` which has at least received one comment.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .has('comments')
  .fetch()
----

ðŸ˜² &nbsp; It is that simple! The `has` method makes sure only to get posts which have at least one comment.

Also, you can pass a count of how many comments should exist.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .has('comments', '>', 2)
  .fetch()
----

==== whereHas
The `whereHas` is similar to `has` but instead you can add more constraints. For example: Fetch all *posts* which has at least 2 *published comments*.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .whereHas('comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', true)
  }, '>', 2)
  .fetch()
----

==== doesntHave
The opposite of `has` clause. This method does not accept a count expression.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .doesntHave('comments')
  .fetch()
----

==== whereDoesntHave
The opposite of `whereHas` clause. This method does not accept a count expression.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .whereDoesntHave('comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', false)
  })
  .fetch()
----

Also you can add `or` clause by calling `orHas`, `orWhereHas`, `orDoesntHave` and `orWhereDoesntHave` methods.

== Counts
Also, you can get counts of relationships by calling the `withCount` method.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .withCount('comments')
  .fetch()

posts.toJSON()
----

The json output will similar as following

[source, js]
----
{
  title: 'Adonis 101',
  __meta__: {
    comments_count: 2
  }
}
----

Also, define an alias for the count

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .withCount('comments as total_comments')
  .fetch()
----

Output
[source, js]
----
__meta__: {
  total_comments: 2
}
----

=== Adding constraints
Let's say you want to pull the count of comments which have been approved.

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .withCount('comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_approved', true)
  })
  .fetch()
----

== Inserts, Updates & Deletes
Adding, updating and deleting related records is again as simple as querying data. Some of the `insertion` methods are specific to certain relationship types.

==== save
The `save` method expects an instance of the related model.

Works with::
- hasOne
- hasMany
- belongsToMany

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const Post = use('App/Models/Post')

const user = await User.find(1)

const post = new Post()
post.title = 'Adonis 101'

await user.posts().save(post)
----

==== create
The `create` is similar to the `save` method, but instead, accepts a normal JavaScript object and returns the related model instance.

Works with::
- hasOne
- hasMany
- belongsToMany

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)

const post = await user
  .posts()
  .create({ title: 'Adonis 101' })
----

==== createMany
Save many related rows to the database.

Works with::
- hasMany
- belongsToMany

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)

const post = await user
  .posts()
  .createMany([
    { title: 'Adonis 101' },
    { title: 'Lucid 101' }
  ])
----

==== saveMany
Same as `save` but instead saves multiple instances of the related model.

Works with::
- hasMany
- belongsToMany

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const Post = use('App/Models/Post')

const user = await User.find(1)

const adonisPost = new Post()
adonisPost.title = 'Adonis 101'

const lucidPost = new Post()
lucidPost.title = 'Lucid 101'

await user
  .posts()
  .saveMany([adonisPost, lucidPost])
----

==== associate
The `associate` method is exclusive to `belongsTo` relationship, where it associates two model instances together.

Continuing with the *user* and the *profile* example, let's `associate` a user with a profile.
[source, js]
----
const Profile = use('App/Models/Profile')
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)
const profile = await Profile.find(1)

await profile.user().associate(user)
----

==== dissociate
The `dissociate` method is the opposite of `associate`, where you just drop the relationship

[source, js]
----
const Profile = use('App/Models/Profile')
const profile = await Profile.find(1)

await profile.user().dissociate()
----

==== attach
The `attach` method works with the belongsToMany relationship to attach a relationship to the `pivot` table.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const Car = use('App/Models/Car')

const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const user = await User.find(1)

await user.cars().attach([mercedes.id])
----

The `attach` method also accepts an optional callback, which receives the `pivotModel` instance, so that you can add extra attributes inside the pivot table if required.

NOTE: The `create` and `save` methods for `belongsToMany` also accepts the attach callback to add extra properties to the pivot table.

[source, js]
----
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const audi = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '99001020')

const user = await User.find(1)
const cars = [mercedes.id, audi.id]

await user.cars().attach(cars, (row) => {
  if (row.car_id === mercedes.id) {
    row.is_current_owner = true
  }
})
----

==== detach
The `detach` method is the opposite of the `attach` method, and it removes the relationship from the pivot table only.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.cars().detach()
----

To detach selected cars, you need to pass an array of ids.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')

await user.cars().detach([mercedes.id])
----

==== sync
The `sync` method is a shortcut for calling `detach` and then `attach` methods. It can be used for updating a pivot table.

[source, js]
----
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const user = await User.find(1)

// Behave the same way as:
// await user.cars().detach()
// await user.cars().attach([mercedes.id])

await user.cars().sync([mercedes.id])
----


==== update
The `update` method is used to make bulk updates on related rows. You can make use of the query builder methods to update specific fields only.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

await user
  .posts()
  .where('title', 'Adonis 101')
  .update({ is_published: true })
----

In the case of updating the pivot table, you can fetch the `query` instance for pivot table only.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

await user
  .cars()
  .pivotQuery()
  .where('name', 'mercedes')
  .update({ is_current_owner: true })
----

==== delete
The `delete` method removes the related row from the database. In case of `belongsToMany`, this method also drops the relationship from `pivotTable`.

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

await user
  .cars()
  .where('name', 'mercedes')
  .delete()
----
