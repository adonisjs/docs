Creating data-driven apps is AdonisJs is comparatively simple with the help of strong Database query builder, link:lucid[Lucid ORM], link:migrations[migrations] and link:seeds-and-factories[database seeder].

In this guide, we understand the basics of Database provider.

NOTE: AdonisJs makes use of link:http://knexjs.org[Knex.js, window="_blank"] internally, so make sure to read the knex docs whenever required.

== Supported databases
Following is the list of supported database and their equivalent drivers.

[options="header"]
|====
| Database | Npm driver
| PostgreSQL | `npm i pg`
| MySQL | `npm i mysql` or +
`npm i mysql2`
| SQLite3 | `npm i sqlite3`
| MariaDB | `npm i mariasql`
| Oracle | `npm i oracledb` or +
`npm i strong-oracle`
| MSSQL | `npm i mssql`
|====

== Setup
Certain project boilerplates have lucid pre-configured by default. If not, here are the setup instructions.

=== Installation
[source, bash]
----
adonis install @adonisjs/lucid
----

Once the installation has been done, register the providers inside `start/app.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const providers = [
  '@adonisjs/lucid/providers/LucidProvider'
]

const aceProviders = [
  '@adonisjs/lucid/providers/MigrationsProvider'
]
----

=== Configuration
Lucid makes use of `sqlite` by default. However, you can change the configuration from `config/database.js` file and choose from one of the available databases.

All of the link:http://knexjs.org/#Installation-client[knex configuration, window="_blank"] options are supported as it is.

== Basic Example
Database query builder has fluent API, which means you can chain JavaScript methods to create SQL queries.

Let's see an example of selecting all users and returning them as JSON.
[source, js]
----
const Database = use('Database')

Route.get('/', async () => {
  return await Database.table('users').select('*')
})
----

=== Where clause
Adding a where clause is as simple as calling a method.

[source, js]
----
Database
  .table('users')
  .where('age', '>', 18)
----

An `orWhere` clause

[source, js]
----
Database
  .table('users')
  .where('age', '>', 18)
  .orWhere('vip', true)
----

Check out the link:query-builder[query builder docs] for complete API reference.

== Multiple connections
By default, AdonisJs makes use of the connection defined inside `config/database.js` file for making all database queries.

However, you can set multiple database connections inside `config/database.js` file, and at runtime, you can select any of the defined connections to make the queries.

[source, js]
----
Database
  .connection('mysql')
  .table('users')
----

Since AdonisJs creates a pool of connections and reuses them, all used connections are maintained unless the process dies.

To close a connection manually, call the `close` method with connection name(s).

[source, js]
----
const users = await Database
  .connection('mysql')
  .table('users')

// later close the connection
Database.close(['mysql'])
----

== Table prefixing
The database provider allows transparent table prefixing for all queries by defining a `prefix` inside the config file.

.config/database.js
[source, js]
----
module.exports = {
  connection: 'sqlite',

  sqlite: {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    prefix: 'my_'
  }
}
----

Now all queries on the `sqlite` connection have `my_` as the table prefix.

[source, js]
----
await Database
  .table('users')
  .select('*')
----

Output
[source, sql]
----
select * from `my_users`
----

==== withOutPrefix
Optionally you can skip the *prefixing* by calling `withOutPrefix`.

[source, js]
----
await Database
  .withOutPrefix()
  .table('users')
----

== Debugging
Debugging database queries can be handy in development as well as in production. Let's go through the available strategies on debugging queries.

=== Globally
By setting `debug: true` inside the config file enables debugging for all queries globally.

.config/database.js
[source, js]
----
module.exports = {
  connection: 'sqlite',

  sqlite: {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    connection: {},
    debug: true
  }
}
----

Also, you can turn on debugging by listening for the `query` event on Database provider. The best place to register a listener is under the `start/hooks.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const { hooks } = require('@adonisjs/ignitor')

hooks.after.providersBooted(() => {
  const Database = use('Database')
  Database.on('query', console.log)
})
----

=== Individually
Also, you can listen for `query` event on a single query at runtime.

[source, js]
----
await Database
  .table('users')
  .select('*')
  .on('query', console.log)
----

////
=== Slow query logs
Tracking slow SQL queries is helpful to keep your app running a healthy mode. AdonisJs makes it easier to track slow SQL queries by listening for the `slow:query` event.

[source, js]
----
Database.on('slow:query', (sql, time) => {
  console.log(`${time}: ${sql.query}`)
})
----

The configuration is saved next to the connection settings in `config/database.js` file.

[source, js]
----
module.exports = {
  connection: 'sqlite',

  sqlite: {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    slowQuery: {
      enabled: true,
      threshold: 5000
    }
  }
}
