= Seeds & Factories

toc::[]

Once you have your database schema ready with link:migrations[migrations], the next step is to add some data. This is where *database seeds* and *factories* come into the picture.

== Seeds
Seeds are JavaScript classes with a `run` method on them. You are free to write any database related operation inside this method.

Just like migrations, a seed file can also be created using the `adonis make` command.

[source, bash]
----
adonis make:seed User
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  database/seeds/UserSeeder.js
----

Now open this file and type the following code inside it.

[source, js]
----
const Factory = use('Factory')
const Database = use('Database')

class UserSeeder {
  async run () {
    const users = await Database.table('users')
    console.log(users)
  }
}

module.exports = UserSeeder
----

Run the seed file by calling `adonis seed`. It executes the `run` method on all the seed files.

Since you can write any database related code inside your seed files and execute them from the command line, they are helpful in offloading some tasks from your actual application code.

However, the real power of seeds is unlocked when you combine them with *Factories*.

== Factories
The database factories are used to define a blueprint of a data structure and then using that blueprint to generate dummy data. Let's check out this example.

The factory blueprints are defined inside `database/factory.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const Factory = use('Factory')
const Hash = use('Hash')

Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', async (faker) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    password: await Hash.make(faker.password())
  }
})
----

Now every time you generate a model instance from this blueprint, it prefills the attributes from the keys we defined.

[source, js]
----
const user = await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .create()
----

Also, we can save multiple rows at a given point of time.

[source, js]
----
const usersArray = await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .createMany(5)
----

=== Creating relationships
It is so simple to use Lucid models and factories to set up associations. Let's say we want to create a post and associate it with a user.

NOTE: Make sure to define the `posts` relationship on the User model for this to work. Learn more about relationships link:relationships[here].

Post blueprint
[source, js]
----
Factory.blueprint('App/Models/Post', (faker) => {
  return {
    title: faker.sentence(),
    body: faker.paragraph()
  }
})
----

User blueprint
[source, js]
----
Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', (faker) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    password: faker.password()
  }
})
----

Now let's use these blueprints to create a user and associate posts with it.

[source, js]
----
const user = await Factory.model('App/Models/User').create()
const post = await Factory.model('App/Models/Post').make()

await user.posts().save(post)
----

You may have noticed that we used the `make` method on the `Post` blueprint. This method does not persist the post inside the database and instead gives us an instance of the `Post` model with pre-filled dummy data.

== Available commands
Below is the list of available commands with their usage and description.

[options="header"]
|====
| Command | Options | Description
| adonis make:seed | None | Make a new seed file
| adonis seed | `--files` | Execute seed files. Also, you can pass a comma-separated list of files to be executed. Otherwise, all files get executed.
|====

== Usage without Lucid
You can also make use of link:query-builder[Database provider] if you have decided not to make use of link:lucid[Lucid models].

The blueprints are defined the same way, but instead, you make use of the `table name` over the model name.

[source, js]
----
Factory.blueprint('users', (faker) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    password: faker.password()
  }
})
----

=== Creating rows
The rows are created using the following factory methods.

[source, js]
----
run () {
  await Factory.get('users').create()
}
----

==== table
A different table name can also be defined at runtime.

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .table('my_users')
  .create()
----

==== returning
For PostgreSQL, you can also define a returning column

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .returning('id')
  .create()
----

==== connection
Choose a different connection at runtime.

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .connection('mysql')
  .returning('id')
  .create()
----

==== createMany
Create multiple rows

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .createMany(3)
----

== Model factories API
Below is the list of available methods when you are using `Lucid models` via Factory.

==== create
Persist and return model instance

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .create()
----

==== createMany
Persist and return many model instances

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .createMany()
----

==== make
Return model instance with prefilled dummy data and do not persist it to the database.

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .make()
----

==== makeMany
Return an array of model instances with prefilled dummy data and do not persist them to the database.

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .makeMany(3)
----

== Custom data
All methods `make`, `makeMany`, `create` and `createMany` accepts a custom data object, which is passed directly to the blueprints. For example

[source, js]
----
const user = await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .create({ status: 'admin' })
----

Now inside your blueprint, you can consume it as follows.

[source, js]
----
Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', async (faker, i, data) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    status: data.status
  }
})
----

== Faker API
The `faker` object passed to factory blueprint is a reference to link:http://chancejs.com[chancejs, window="_blank"] library. Make sure to read their documentation for the list of available methods and properties.

== FAQ's
Since factories and seeds fit into many different use cases, the chances are you may get confused on how and when to use them. So here is the list of some frequently asked questions.

[ol-spaced]
1. *Does factories and seeds have to be used together?* +
  No. Factories and seeds are not dependent upon each other and can be used independently. +
For example, you can make use of seed files to import data from a different app to Adonisjs app.

2. *Can I use factories when writing tests?* +
  Yes. Just import the factory provider and use it.

3. *How to run only selected seed files?* +
  You can pass `--files` with a list of comma-separated filenames to `adonis seed` command. It makes sure to run only those files.
+
[source, bash]
----
adonis seed --files='UsersSeeder.js, PostsSeeder.js'
