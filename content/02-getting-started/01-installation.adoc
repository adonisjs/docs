This guide will get you started with AdonisJs by installing the framework and required dependencies. By the end of this guide, you will have a working AdonisJs web server with the *Hello world* page.

If you face any troubles installing AdonisJs, please file an issue on link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework[github].

== Requirements
Since AdonisJs is a Node.js framework, please make sure Node.js is installed on your operating system with npm. Below are the minimum required versions.

[ol-shrinked]
1. link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js] 8.0 or greater.
2. link:https://www.npmjs.com[Npm] 3.0 or greater.

TIP: You can also make use of link:https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage and run multiple versions of Node.js

== Cli tool
Once requirements to run AdonisJs Apps are met, the next step is to install the *cli* tool, which will help us in creating new AdonisJs applications.

The cli tool is installed globally using npm.

[source, bash]
----
npm i -g @adonisjs/cli
----

Once the installation completes, make sure that you can run `adonis` from your command line.

[source, bash]
----
adonis --help
----
Continue, if everything works as expected. Otherwise please create an issue on link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework[github]

== Creating new app
Let's start by creating a new application using the cli tool `new` command. It accepts the project name/folder as a required parameter.

[source, bash]
----
adonis new yardstick
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
    _       _             _         _

✔ Your current Node.js & npm version match the AdonisJs requirements!
✔ Cloned [adonisjs/adonis-slim-app]
✔ npm: Dependencies installed
✔ Default environment variables copied
✔ generated unique APP_KEY

│        cd yardstick               │
│        adonis serve --dev         │

== Running application
Once the installation process is completed, you can `cd` into the directory and run the following command to start the HTTP server.

[source, bash]
----
adonis serve --dev
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
Started server in dev mode

[date] - info: serving app on http://127.0.0.1:3333
----

The `serve` command starts the HTTP server on port defined inside the `.env` file in the project root. If you open http://127.0.0.1:3333 inside your browser, you will see the following *welcome page*.

== Customizing new command

[ol-spaced]
1. The `adonis new <PATH>` command creates the project directory and does `npm install` for you automatically. You can pass `--yarn` to make use of yarn over npm.
2. By default link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-slim-app[slim app] blueprint will be cloned from github, which can be customized by passing `--full-stack` or `--api-only` flag. Which will clone appropriate repos for you.
3. To make use of community created blueprints, you can pass `--blueprint=<github-org/repo>`.

TIP: When in doubt, make use of the `adonis new --help` command to see the list of available options.

== Next steps
This guide was small and focused only on the installation part of the process. Going forward we will learn about more HTTP specific features and the link:folder-structure[folder structure].
