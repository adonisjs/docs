AdonisJs is primarily a web framework which deals over HTTP protocol. In this guide we will learn how AdonisJs handles the HTTP requests through registered routes or middleware.

== Request flow
Below is a flow chart on how HTTP request flow works +

1. The server level middleware stack includes a middleware to serve static resources from the `public` directory. You should only add server level middleware, when they can override the URL's registered by routes.
2. If a request is not intercepted by server level middleware, AdonisJs will look for a registered route, if a route is found, the global, named middleware and route action is executed.
3. Otherwise a 404 exception is thrown.

== Http context
Since Node.js handles HTTP requests concurrently, each request needs to be identified and managed uniquely. AdonisJs will create a request *Context* which is a class instance containing all the request related data.

So when you bind a handler to the `Route`, that handler is executed for each request matching that URL and receives a unique `context` instance.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', (ctx) => {
  // ctx.request
  // ctx.response
})
----

Or you can make use of ES6 destructuring.

[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', ({ request, response }) => {
  // ctx.request
  // ctx.response
})
----

The best part of context object is that you can pull a lot more objects from it. For example: `auth`, `view` etc.

== Public directory
The `public` directory in the root of your application is registered to serve static resources like *css*, *images* and *fonts* etc.

All files inside directory are available publicly without any authentication or restrictions.

== Views
There are couple of ways to make use of views and it's really important to understand the difference between them. One way is to import the *View* provider and other is to use the HTTP specific view instance.

=== Import manually
[source, js]
----
const View = use('View')

// render view
const html = View.render('home', {})
----

=== Http view instance
[source, js]
----
Route.get('/', async ({ view }) => {
  return view.render('home')
})
----

The fundamental difference is that the HTTP view instance contains a bunch of request specific locals like: *request*, *authenticated user* etc.

So always make sure to use the HTTP view instance during request lifecycle.
