= Upgrading from 4.0

toc::[]

The 4.1 release contains bunch of *bug fixes* and *API improvements* to keep the code base simple and less magical. I tried to keep the breaking changes as few as possible, however cannot eliminate them completely.

== Getting started

The first step is to get the latest version of all dependencies. I personally use link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check[npm-check] to pull latest versions of packages.

[source, bash]
----
npm install -g npm-check
----

Run the following command to interactively update dependencies.

[source, bash]
----
npm-check -u
----

== Exception handling
One of the biggest changes have been done in the link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework/issues/718[Global exception handler].

Make the following changes inside `app/Exceptions/Handler.js` file. Feel free to ignore this section, if you never created the global exception handler.

1. Make sure your exception handler extends the `BaseExceptionHandler`.
+
[source, js]
----
const BaseExceptionHandler = use('BaseExceptionHandler')

class ExceptionHandler extends BaseExceptionHandler {
}
----

2. Call `super.handle` for exceptions you don't want to handle.
+
[source, js]
----
class ExceptionHandler extends BaseExceptionHandler {
  async handle (error, { response }) {
    if (error.name === 'UserNotFoundException') {
      // handle it yourself
      return
    }

    super.handle(...arguments)
  }
}
----

3. At last you can remove `Exception.bind` calls from your codebase, since all exceptions will be routed to the global exception handler.

== Routing

==== Route.url

The `Route.url` generates a fully qualified URL to a pre-registered route. Earlier the `domain` was passed as a string literal and now it is accepted as an object.

Earlier
[source, js]
----
Route.url('posts/:id', { id: 1 }, 'blog.adonisjs.com')
----

Now
[source, js]
----
Route.url('posts/:id', { id: 1 }, { domain: 'blog.adonisjs.com' })
----

== Validator
The validator provider now uses latest version of Indicative. Here's the list of breaking changes due to API changes done in Indicative.

==== formatters
There is no concept of named formatters anymore. If you want to use a pre-existing formatter, you pass it as a reference, instead of passing it's name.

Earlier
[source, js]
----
const { validate } = use('Validator')
validate(data, rules, messages, 'jsonapi')
----

Now
[source, js]
----
const { validate, formatters } = use('Validator')
validate(data, rules, messages, formatters.JsonApi)
----

The same applies to route validators too.

Earlier
[source, js]
----
class StoreUser {
  get formatter () {
    return 'jsonapi'
  }
}
----

Now
[source, js]
----
const { formatters } = use('Validator')

class StoreUser {
  get formatter () {
    return formatters.JsonApi
  }
}
----

==== configure
New version of Indicative exposes the link:http://indicative.adonisjs.com/docs/api/configure[configure] method to define library wide defaults. They same can be used with Validator provider too.

[source, js]
----
const { formatters, configure } = use('Validator')

configure({
  FORMATTER: formatters.JsonApi
})
----

== Lucid
Date formatting was inconsistent with newly created records and already existing records. Same has been fixed in the newer release with a *small breaking change*. Make sure to read the link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-lucid/issues/245[related issue].

==== dates
The date fields will longer be casted to `moment` instances on the model instance. For example

Earlier
[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
user.created_at instanceof moment // true
----

Now
[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
user.created_at instanceof moment // false
----

This change prevents you from mutating the date on the model instance directly and instead make use of `castDates` hook to mutate the date when you serialize the model properties.

The `castDates` hook will work as earlier

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static castDates (field, value) {
    if (field === 'dob') {
      return `${value.fromNow(true)} old`
    }
    return super.formatDates(field, value)
  }
}
----

== Goodies
Bunch of bug fixes have been done to keep the codebase reliable. Also a handful of perfomance improvements have been done.

==== Validator
Since indicative is written from groundup, the new version is `2x faster` than the old one.

==== Middleware
The middleware parsing layer now resolves all middleware at the time of booting the app and just instantiates a new instance of them for each request. Whereas earlier the *resolve* process was done for each request.

==== Betters errors
The errors will appear in a nice formatted way on your terminal as shown in the screenshot.
